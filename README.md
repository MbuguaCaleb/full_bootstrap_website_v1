**Short notes**

**Bootstrap Design**

```
Everything in this website falls under the body section.
(a)bootstrap scroll-spy

You should have relative ids for the nabvar and each other section so as to implemement the scrollspy or sticky  navigation bar.

[ids very crucial is scrolling through the website.]


(b)Position absolute enables you to vertically align elements by percentage.


(c)You have a row class in bootstrap when you want to split your web page into columns

(d)Bootstrap has got powerful classes example..text center class

(e)Grids are by columns in bootstrap

(f)Margin is used to separate two html components  from each other..


(g)To make the background image to display underneath the content  we use the z-index property.


To remove white space brween sections we assign the margin bottom property to zero.

Wow..margin top and margin bottom for spacing..

What a great idea..
Hr stands for horizontal rule.


! important is sometimes added so that a style takes effect.

Remember the tip of the bootstrap media queries which begin one pixel less.


(h)display:block margin :0auto can be used to center an image.


Thank you God!!
